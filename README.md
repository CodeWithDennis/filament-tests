A package that creates PEST tests specifically tailored for your Filament components.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The project is currently on hold as both active maintainers are unable to dedicate time due to work commitments and other responsibilities. However, we encourage anyone in the community to contribute and help keep the project alive. Your efforts would make a big difference in maintaining its momentum.

## Early development

This package is still in early development. Some features may not be available yet or may not work as expected. If you encounter any issues, please create an [issue](https://github.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-tests/issues) on this repository.

> [!CAUTION]  
> This package is not production-ready yet, use it at your own risk. ⚠️

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require codewithdennis/filament-tests --dev
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-tests-config"
```

## Requirements

This package requires [Filament v3](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/installation) or later to run.

This package generates [PestPHP](https://pestphp.com/docs/installation) tests, make sure you have it installed in your project. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest --dev --with-all-dependencies
```

Make sure you have the following plugins installed as well:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire --dev
```
```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-laravel --dev
```

## Usage

You can create a new test for a resource by running the following command:
> The following name formats are supported: `blog`, `Blog`, `BlogResource`

```bash
php artisan make:filament-test BlogResource
```

You can also pass a comma-separated list of resource names to create tests for multiple resources at once:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-test "BlogResource, PostResource"
```

If you don't specify a resource name, you will be prompted to choose one or more resources to create tests for interactively.

```bash
php artisan make:filament-test
````
## Options

| Option             | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--all` `-a`       | Create tests for all Filament resources                                |
| `--directory` `-d` | The output directory for the test                                      |
| `--except` `-e`    | Create tests for all Filament resources except the specified resources |
| `--force` `-f`     | Overwrite existing tests                                               |
| `--only` `-o`      | Create tests for the specified resources                               |

## Tests
Tests are generated on demand and are tailored to the component that you're generating tests for. For example, if the resource component doesn't have any sortable columns, then the tests for sorting 
won't be generated.
